## Resources

### Shell

NUIT's [command line workshop](https://github.com/nuitrcs/commandlineworkshop) includes some exercises and a well-curated list of resources. I'll add some commentary on what resources I think are useful for data analysts who need a working understanding of Bash, shells, and Unix.

Software Carpentry's [Unix Shell](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/) course is a useful and matter-of-fact introduction. It probably won't convince you just how broadly useful the shell really is, though.

[Learn Enough Command Line to be Dangerous](https://www.learnenough.com/command-line-tutorial), by Michael Hartl, is an excellent and realistic introduction with good exercises. I wish it had existed when I started learning this stuff. My only quibble is that the author is a macOS proselytizer, which I find unhelpful and out of step with the current landscape--Bash is for Windows users too!

Once you're comfortable with that, you can follow it up with [Learn Enough Text Editor to be Dangerous](https://www.learnenough.com/text-editor-tutorial). This might not be that exciting, but practicing this stuff will make you faster and more productive.

If you'd like a really accessible intro to the nuts and bolts of how all this stuff actually works, I like [Julia Evans'](https://twitter.com/b0rk) work. She [writes](https://jvns.ca/) a blog as well as ingenious [comics](https://twitter.com/i/moments/1026078161115729920) that teach Linux and Bash.

If you liked the DataCamp introductory R course, they also offer a free [shell course](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-shell-for-data-science).

### Git

Software Carpentry's [Version Control with Git](http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/) course is what we followed along with on day 2. Like their Bash course, it doesn't really introduce you to a real-world workflow, but it does help you understand the basic mechanics in a straightforward way.

Michael Hartl also wrote [Learn Enough Git to be Dangerous](https://www.learnenough.com/git-tutorial). Just like his Bash and Text Editor tutorials, this is great for developing a practical understanding of the parts of Git that you really need to know.

NUIT also has a [Git resource list](https://github.com/nuitrcs/gitworkshop).


## Authorship

The R materials used on 9/17 and 9/18 are based on the [Intro to R workshop](https://github.com/nuitrcs/r_intro_june2018) from NUIT Research Computing Services, created by Christina Maimone. They have been expanded and modified by Kumar Ramanathan and Richard Morel. The materials on data.table used on 9/18 were originally developed by Ali Ehlen. The materials on ggplot2 used on 9/19 were originally developed by Kumar Ramanathan. Richard Morel, Ali Ehlen, and Kumar Ramanathan all jointly developed the overarching sequence of the sessions as well as the synthetic final exercise on 9/19.
