############ MSiA Boot Camp: Intro to R: Day 1 Exercises #############
### by Kumar Ramanathan, based on materials from Christina Maimone ###

#### REVIEW: BASICS AND DATA TYPES ####

#### Arithmetic ####

# Pick a number; save it as x
x<-5

# Multiply x by 3
x*3

# Take the log of the above (Hint, you need the function log() here)
log(x*3)

# Subtract 4 from the above
log(x*3)-4

# Square the above
(log(x*3)-4)^2

#### Comparisons and Logical Operators ####

# Check if 1 is bigger than 2


# Check if 1 + 1 is equal to 2
1+1 == 2

# Check if it is true that the strings "eat" and "drink" are not equal to each other


# Check if it is true that 1 is equal to 1 *AND* 1 is equal to 2 
# (Hint: remember what the operators & and | do)


# Check if it is true that 1 is equal to 1 *OR* 1 is equal to 2


#### Packages and Functions ####

# Load the package tidyverse
library(tidyverse)

# Open the help file for the function recode 
# (Hint: remember what ? does)


#### REVIEW: DATA STRUCTURES ####

#### Vectors ####

# Run this code to generate variables x1 and x2
set.seed(1234)
x1 <- rnorm(5)
x2 <- rnorm(20, mean=0.5)

# Select the 3rd element in x1
x1[3]

# Select the elements of x1 that are less than 0
x1[x1 < 0]

# Select the elements of x2 that are greater than 1
x2[x2 > 1]

# Create x3 containing the first five elements of x2
x3 <- x2[1:5]

# Select all but the third element of x1
x1[-3]

#### Missing values ####

# Generate a vector
vec <- c(1, 8, NA, 7, 3)

# Calculate the mean of vec, excluding the NA value


# Count the number of missing values in vec


#### Factors ####

# See lecture notes and DataCamp for guidance and practice


#### Lists ####

# See lecture notes and DataCamp for guidance and practice


#### Matricies ####

# Generate a matrix
mat <- matrix(c(1:51, rep(NA,4)), ncol=5)

# Select row 4, column 5


# Select column 3


# Bonus: How many NA values are there in this matrix?


#### Data frames ####

# Load one of R's example data frames, mtcars
data(mtcars)

# Identify the number of observations (rows) and number of variables (columns)
dim(mtcars)

# Identify the names of the variables
names(mtcars)

# Select the variable 'mpg'
mtcars$mpg

# Select the 4th row
mtcars[4,]

# Square the value of the 'cyl' variable and store this as a new variable 'cylsq'
mtcars$cylsq <- (mtcars$cyl)^2

#### READING FILES ####

# Check your working directory. It should be the root folder where you downloaded the boot camp materials. If that's not the case, set your working directory accordingly.


# Read gapminder data with read.csv()
gapminder <- read.csv("data/gapminder5.csv", stringsAsFactors=FALSE)

# Load the readr package
library(readr)

# Read gapminder data with read_csv()
gapminder <- read_csv("data/gapminder5.csv")

#### DATA MANIPULATION ####

#### Exploring data frames ####

# Run summary() on the gapminder data


# Find the mean of the variable pop


# Create a frequency table of the variable 'year'
# Hint: use table()


# Create a proportion table of the variable 'continent'
# Hint: use prop.table()


#### Subsetting and Sorting ####

# Create a new data frame called gapminder07 contaning only those rows in the gapminder data where year is 2007
gapminder07 <- subset(gapminder, subset = year==2007)

# Created a sorted frequency table of the variable continent in gapminder07
sort(table(gapminder07$continent))

# Print out the population of Mexico in 2007
gapminder07$pop[gapminder07$country=="Mexico"]

# BONUS: Print out the rows represnting the 5 countries with the highest population in 2007
# Hint: Use order(), which we learned about, and head(), which prints out the first 5 rows of a data frame


#### Adding and removing columns ####

# See lecture notes for more guidance. We will practice this skill in the next section.


#### Recoding variables ####

# Round the values of the variable `lifeExp` using `round()` and store this as a new variable `lifeExp_round`


# Print out the new variable to see what it looks like


# This code creates the new variable 'lifeExp_over70'. Try to understand what it does.
gapminder07$lifeExp_over70 <- NA  # Initialize a variable containing all "NA" values
gapminder07$lifeExp_over70[gapminder07$lifeExp>70] <- "Yes"
gapminder07$lifeExp_over70[gapminder07$lifeExp<70] <- "No"
table(gapminder07$lifeExp_over70)

# Try to create a new variable 'lifeExp_highlow' that has the value 
# "High" when life expectancy is over the mean and the value "Low" 
# when it is below the mean. When you are done, print a frequency table.

gapminder07$lifeExp_highlow <- NA
gapminder07$lifeExp_highlow[gapminder07$lifeExp>mean(gapminder07$lifeExp)] <- "High"
gapminder07$lifeExp_highlow[gapminder07$lifeExp<mean(gapminder07$lifeExp)] <- "Low"
table(gapminder07$lifeExp_highlow)

#### Aggregating ####

# Find the mean of life expectancy in 2007 for each continent
# Hint: use the aggregate() function
aggregate(gapminder07$lifeExp ~ gapminder07$continent, FUN = mean)
aggregate(lifeExp ~ continent, data = gapminder07, FUN = mean)
#### Statistics, part 1 ####

# Calculate the correlation between 'lifeExp' and 'gdpPercap'.
cor(gapminder07$lifeExp, gapminder07$gdpPercap)

# Use a t-test to evaluate the difference between 'gdpPercap' in "high" and "low" life expectancy countries. Store the results as t1, and then print out t1.
t1 <- t.test(gapminder07$gdpPercap~gapminder07$lifeExp_highlow)
t1 <- t.test(gdpPercap~lifeExp_highlow, data=gapminder07)

#### Statistics, part 2 ####

# Conduct a linear regression predicting 'lifeExp' as a function of 'gdpPercap' and 'pop', and store the results as reg1.
reg1 = lm(lifeExp ~ gdpPercap + pop, data = gapminder07)

# Print out reg1.
print(reg1)

# Run summary() on reg1.
summary(reg1)

#### WRITING FILES ####

#### Writing a data file ####

# Save the gapminder07 data frame as a CSV file using write.csv() in the "data" subfolder within the working directory
# Set the argument `row.names = FALSE`.
write.csv(gapminder07, file = "data/gapminder07.csv", row.names = FALSE)

#### Save R objects ####

# See lecture notes for guidance and more examples.


#### DATA VISUALIZATION ####

#### Histograms ####

# Create a histogram of the variable 'lifeExp' in gapminder07
hist(gapminder07$lifeExp, main="Distribution of life expectancy across countries in 2007", 
     xlab="Life expectancy", ylab="Frequency")

# Re-create the histogram with a title and axis labels


# Bonus: Change the `breaks = ` argument from its default setting and see what happens.
hist(gapminder07$lifeExp, breaks = 20, main="Distribution of life expectancy across countries in 2007", 
     xlab="Life expectancy", ylab="Frequency")

#### Scatterplots ####

# Create a scatterplot with `lifeExp` on the y-axis and `gdpPercap` on the x-axis.
plot(lifeExp ~ gdpPercap, data = gapminder07)

# Add a title and axis labels.
plot(lifeExp ~ gdpPercap, data = gapminder07, main="Relationship between life expectancy and GDP per capita in 2007", 
     ylab="Life expectancy", xlab="GDP per capita")

# Bonus: Add a horizontal line indicating the mean of `lifeExp` onto the plot using `abline()`.
abline(h = mean(gapminder07$lifeExp))
